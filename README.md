# Contributing
## How to contribute an implementation (code)?
* Have a look at open issues, they contain the list of algorithms/DS we plan to be implemented.
* You can also create a new issue for an algorithm that is not in the list.
* Fork the repository.
* Clone the repo. to your local system.
* Add the algorithms/codes that you want to contribute (and properly rename you algorithm/code, also if possible keep in the respective folder)
* Make another Development branch. (Apart from main branch).
* Open the pull request.
* Resolve conflicts ( if any ).
* Wait for the pull request to be approved.
